# KMA_InformationRetrieval_Dictionaty_Python3

This my study project in Nation University of
[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy](http://www.ukma.edu.ua). It is written
on Python, which is new for me at the moment of beginning.

The first task is to create a dictionary of words from multiple
text files, using an array (mandatory) or some structure (optional)
as data structure.
